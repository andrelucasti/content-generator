# TDD Rules

1. **One Test at a Time**
   - Write only one test
   - Run it to see it fail (RED)
   - Write minimal code to make it pass (GREEN)
   - Refactor if needed
   - Only then move to the next test

2. **Test Granularity**
   - Start with core domain tests
   - Move outward following Onion Architecture
   - Test one behavior per test

3. **Commit Cycle**
   - Commit after each RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
   - Include both test and implementation in commit
   - Use descriptive commit messages

4. **Test Organization**
   - Follow the same package structure as production code
   - Name test classes with suffix "Test"
   - Group related tests in nested classes if needed
